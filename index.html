                            <p>Tribal tattoos originated about 5000 years ago during the Bronze age.<br>
                        Today, they signify courage, hardwork and boldness. In some European cultures,<br>
                        they have also been considered as a form of membership.<br>
                        Members of the same association, organization or<br>
                        cult used to wear similar tribal tattoos to identify themselves.</p>

                            But what does it represent? A semicolon in English grammar<br>
                            means a pause, but not period. Which means that a semicolon<br>
                            is a break but not the end of the statement.<br>
                            Similarly, semicolon represents that a will of the character.<br>
                            It says that my story is not over yet. It says that I’ll be back.<br>
                            It says that the game is not over.</p>
